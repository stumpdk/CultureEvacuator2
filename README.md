Let's save the culture from big evil FACEBOOK!

In fact, this is a humble attempt in what we see as crowdsourcing 2.0. The communication about digitalized cultural material is in itself a huge source to knowledge.
We try to save this knowledge from Facebook, remove the noise and present the user generated content to the public.

To install: Use git clone

To run: Go to /harvester/fb_harvest.php, and get some posts loaded.
If you need to create the database, you find the database structure in harvester/database_structure.sql

To get some keywords go to /api/public/1/?type=searchposts&q=YOUR_SEARCH_TERM
